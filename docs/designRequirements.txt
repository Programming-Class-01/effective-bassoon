Implementing the card game War with some added features
    Objective is to win all of the cards.
        Play until one player runs out of cards.

    Suit is ignored, Ace is high. Implement as 2-14
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack 11, Queen 12, King 13,
        Ace 14
    
    If both players show the same value card, there is a "war".
        Each player places the top card face down, then places the
        next card face up. When one player has played a higher value
        card, they "win" the war, and adds all cards from the war to 
        their "spoils" pile.
    
    The game ends when one or more players run out of cards.

    Ask if the players would like to play again, and display card totals
    from "spoils".
